Configuration for my i3 setup. This uses Ubuntu Gnome as a base,
so some programs that I'm using in my scripts might not be 
available if you're trying to run this from a different
distro.

## TODO
- Fix statusline.
	- "tasks" should show on the left side.
	- Don't want to see skype icon...
- fix color for dmenu_run
- fix color for network manager
- fix color for sound card manager
- Monitor management
